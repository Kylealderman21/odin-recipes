        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Cooking wings in the air fryer is the best way to get them extremely crispy while keeping them relatively healthy.
        <br>The secret to getting these wings extremely crispy is to brine them for a couple hours in the refrigerator with salt,
        <br>baking soda and cornstarch. This will help draw our excess moisture and get them extremely crispy while air frying.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3lbs of Whole Wings</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>1 Cup Franks Red Hot Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon Cornstarch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, prep your wings by patting them dry and cutting them into drums and flats 
                (If this if your first time, check out this article here on how to cut wings 
                <a href="https://www.evolvingtable.com/how-to-cut-chicken-wings/">How to cut wings)</a></li>
            <li>Add your wings to a large bowl and add your salt, baking soda, and cornstarch</li>
            <li>Mix well and let this sit in the refrigerator for at least a couple hours (preferably 8 hours)</li>
            <li>Once you lose patience, take your wings and place them in the air fryer skin side down</li>
            <li>Set your air fryer to 400 degrees fahrenheit for 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Make sure to flip them half way through (10 minutes)</li>
            <li>When the wings are almost done, grad a small sauce pan and add your butter and Franks Red Hot sauce</li>
            <li>Combine the butter and sauce on medium low heat until completely mixed together</li>
            <li>Once the wings are done and crispy, add them to a large bowl and toss them in your homemade buffalo sauce</li>
            <li>Enjoy with carrots, celery, and ranch</li>
        </ol>
